            The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss-primeui" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tailwindcss-primeui</a> is an official plugin by wangsTek to provide first class integration between a wangs UI library like
            wangsVue and Tailwind CSS. It is designed to work both in styled and unstyled modes. For example, in styled mode the semantic colors such as primary and surfaces are provided as Tailwind utilities e.g. <i>bg-primary</i>,
            <i>text-surface-500</i>, <i>text-muted-color</i> by deriving their values from the design tokens. This integration is not compatible with wangsVue v3 and requires wangsVue v4.
