            Tailwind CSS in particular is a popular choice, we have even built the <a href="https://tailwind.wangsvue.org">Tailwind CSS presets</a> spin-off project for the unstyled mode to be able to use the utility classes to style the wangsVue
            components. During this work, we've realized that the value added by wangsFlex such as providing the wangsVue theming as utility classes can be implemented as a Tailwind plugin. As part of wangsVue v4, a tailwind-primeui plugin has been
            created for the seamless integration, the website templating demos have been migrated from wangsFlex to Tailwind and a converter tool called <i>pf2tw</i> has been created. In summary, wangsTek officially suggests Tailwind CSS as the
            replacement for wangsFlex.
