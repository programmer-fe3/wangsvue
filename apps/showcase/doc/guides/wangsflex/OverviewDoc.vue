            <a href="https://wangsflex.org">wangsFlex</a> is designed to be a lightweight CSS utility to accompany wangs UI libraries. As part of our product roadmap planning at wangsTek, the team has decided to avoid the maintenance of a CSS library
            and utilize the resources on improving the UI libraries instead. Community feedback has been essential in this decision as well since majority of the applications have their own CSS utilities whether it is Tailwind, Bootstrap or an
            in-house one, as a result adding wangsFlex to a project was causing overlapping functionality.
